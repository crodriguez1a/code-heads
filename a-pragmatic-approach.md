At Code-Heads, we're keenly aware of the pace at which both students and engineers live, which is why we've resolved ourselves to be as pragmatic as possible about how we approach mentorship. Here are some of the guidelines we use to ensure that a mentorship is engaging and fruitful.

- **Using all the tools** - Resources for online learning are readily available and largely free. When an engineer doesn't have a moment to explain a concept, it's his or her responsibility to curate a great blog, article, or free course for a student to engage with, until the next one-on-one.

- **Students should team up** - It's critical for students to learn to work well with teammates, and learn from one another. Engineers can set up Github teams, and Google hangouts to facilitate student collaboration on any particular challenge.

- **Teach open source** - An entire curriculum can be outlined in a single open source project. Engineers can guide students through the contribution process and work through challenges as they arise.

- **Remote Mentorships work too** - With Slacks integration of ScreenHero and so many other tools that facilitate remote communication in real-time, distance should never be a problem.
