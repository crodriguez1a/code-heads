### Assignments - Building a Login

##### Goals
- Getting familiar with HTML

- Learning to leverage community libraries (a.k.a., open source libraries)
  - **Libraries** - Collections of code shared openly by a community of engineers/developers.


- Reading and understanding library documentation
  - **documentation** - A set guides for writing code using a community library

##### Instructions

  1. Login to [CodeAnywhere](http://codeanywhere.com)
  - Click on your chat app connection to and select `index.html` to edit
  - Inside of the `body`, create a `section` following the example provided on [Bulma.io/section](http://bulma.io/documentation/layout/section/)
  - Inside of your section, create a form using the HTML `form` tag. We'll discuss form tags and their functionality on our next session. Your form should go inside of the section you created on the previous step.

        <form>
          <!-- Your login will live here-->
        </form>

  - Now for the fun part. Using the examples provided on [Bulma.io/form](http://bulma.io/documentation/elements/form/), create a login form that has the following:

    - An input field with a label called "username" (extra credit if you can also add an email icon)

    - An input field with a label called "password" (extra credit if the password is masked)

    - A submit button (extra credit if your button is blue, or has an icon from [FontAwesome.io](http://fontawesome.io/))


Your finished product should look something like this:
