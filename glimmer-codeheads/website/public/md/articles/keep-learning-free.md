Okay, here comes a strong opinion...technology education should be free. At the Code-Heads Club, one core principle that is deeply guarded here at Code-Heads, is that Technology as a career must remain attainable for anyone willing to learn. Economics should certainly not preclude a student from pursuing something great for themselves.

The fact remains that the most difficult barriers to a successful engineer/student mentorship are access to hardware and to the internet. At Code-Heads, we recommend that mentors and students try the following:

- Engineers, hop on your local community message board (Facebook, NextDoor, etc.) and shamelessly ask for laptops. People often have older machines laying around, and we can take advantage of cloud computing to bridge any gaps.

- Engineers can afford to buy computers! It's no secret that [for this moment in time] engineering is rather lucrative. Engineers, raid your local pawn-shops and collect one or two decent machines that you can lend to students.

- Students, get to know your local librarian or your school media teacher (and maybe convince them to install Chrome Canary). Make sure to reserve a computer for at least an hour a week. Engineers will show you how to use tools like CodeAnywhere and Chrome Dev Tools so that you can have a top-notch coding environment with just a browser.

- Students, if you do have a laptop, but don't have high-speed internet, map your local hot spots. Use sites like https://workfrom.co/ to find places with a decent connection.
