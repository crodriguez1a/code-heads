Okay, here comes a strong opinion...technology education should be free. A core principle of the Code-Heads Club is that Technology as a career must remain attainable for anyone willing to learn it. Economics should certainly not preclude a student from creating something great.

In practice, the most difficult barriers to a successful engineer/student mentorship are hardware and access to the internet. We recommend the following:

- **Engineers**, hop on your local community message board (Facebook, NextDoor, etc.) and shamelessly ask for laptops. People often have older machines laying around, and we can take advantage of cloud computing to bridge any gaps.

- **Engineers** can afford to buy computers! It's no secret that [for this moment in time] engineering is rather lucrative. Engineers, raid your local pawn-shops and collect one or two decent machines that you can lend to students.

- **Students**, get to know your local librarian or your school media teacher (and maybe convince them to install Chrome Canary). Make sure to reserve a computer for at least hour a week. Engineers will show you how to use tools like CodeAnywhere and Chrome Dev Tools, so that you can have a top notch coding environment with just a browser.

- **Students**, if you do have a laptop, map your hot spots. Use sites like [https://workfrom.co/](https://workfrom.co/) to find places with a decent connection.
